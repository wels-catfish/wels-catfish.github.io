			<h2>"But, but, thorium!"</h2>
			<div id="thorium"><img src="images/thorium.jpg" alt="Thorium sample" class="desktop">
			<p>If you tour any pro-nuclear space, you will inevitably come across a barrage of people praising thorium as the nuclear Prometheus.<br><hr>
			<p>Thorium is a radioactive element, number 90. One of the largest arguments for using nuclear that quells the fears of anti-nuclear advocates is: "Use thorium - it's safer, cheaper, and more plentiful!" No. According to <a href="https://whatisnuclear.com/thorium.html">whatisnuclear.com</a>, there are several cons. First of all, in most cases, thorium actually <i>is</i> more expensive. It has a much higher melting point (550 degrees higher than uranium), meaning more work, heat, and money must be spent to melt it down into anything usable. Additionally, it only works with any quick efficiency (the whole reason we're investing in it) in neutron reactors, not any other type.
			<p><br>In regards to the fear of proliferation and how thorium is useless, think again. This argument states that thorium can be proliferated overseas since it cannot be made into a weapon. Again, no. It is simply <i>harder</i> to weaponize, not that it can't be used at all. The highly-radioactive element protactinium can be chemically separated from thorium, and from there, the protactinium can later decay right back into uranium. All this will do is fund the terrorists' nuclear economy, not stop anything! Do we want that? Overall, thorium may be slightly better in the short run, but who's to say the rogue states overseas won't just invest in turning thorium into an instrument of terror?</div>

			<h2>"But, but, we must invest in it!"</h2>
			<div id="invest"><img src="images/money.jpg" alt="Money" class="desktop">
			<p>Another frequent argument is that of the price. They will say that we have to invest in it, and that's when it will be safe.<br><hr>
			<p>Let's take a peek at another argument. This argument is particularly effective coming from apologists because they know that everyone loves money.
			<p><br>According to <a href="https://beyondnuclearinternational.org/2023/02/05/nuclear-too-expensive-and-not-needed">beyondnuclearinternational.com</a>, nuclear energy actually costs more than what we expect. It is more expensive and runs slower than other forms of green energy, like wind. Not that wind is without issues, of course. However, the total costs of renewable energy (which, by the way, nuclear is not) is actually less than the total expenditure of nuclear. In many countries, the problem of nuclear waste is still "unsolved", and costs the state incredible amounts of money in an attempt to bury. You don't need to bury wind and water. No matter how much you invest in nuclear, there will always be waste, there will always be high costs, and there will always be money going into the pockets of those who build the plants. Do you think a government will sit back and let their profits go to someone else? They want a return on their investment - it doesn't matter how much you invest.</div>

			<h2>"But, but, the accident was from human error!"</h2>
			<div id="error"><img src="images/chernobyl2.jpg" alt="Money" class="desktop">
			<p>Right, but it still happened though! It doesn't matter whose error it was, human or mechanical, a boatload of people got fatal doses of cancer! This was a complete tragedy that could have been avoided had engineers not used unclear. The agent of the error doesn't matter.</div>

			<h2>"But, but, it's more contained and clean!"</h2>
			<div id="clean"><img src="images/crocus.jpg" alt="Money" class="desktop">
			<p>Another argument: "It's so much cleaner than other forms of energy. It's all in one site!"<br><hr>
			<p>As it turns out, storing tons of highly radioactive material in one location for long periods of time can result in some pretty squinty things. According to the crazy conspiracy-theorist source <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/radioactive-leaks-found-at-75-of-us-nuke-sites/">CBS News</a> (allegedly), radioactive leaks have been found at three-quarters of all inspected nuclear reactors in the US. Already, that should be ringing alarms bells in your head. If you're still okay with nuclear energy being anywhere near you after reading that, I'd read the article again.</div>
