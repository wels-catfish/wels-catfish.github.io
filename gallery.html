	<div id="yucca"><img src="images/yucca.jpg"><p>Nuclear energy is so safe that the US government has to store incredible amounts of nuclear waste and spent fuel in one gigantic mountain in the middle of the Nevada desert that will be radioactive for the next million years. <a href="https://www.ieer.org/latest/yuccaepapr0805.html">But don't take my word for it.</a></div>
	
	<div id="goiania"><img src="images/goiania.jpg"><p>Nuclear energy is so safe that an entire town in Brazil needed to be cleaned and decontaminated from one aquamarine blue dust in a junkyard that turned out to be caesium chloride, killing 4 and radiating hundreds.</div>

Wouldn't want to spread that radiation everywhere! But hey, it was only a minor accident, you know?</div>
