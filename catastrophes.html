		<p><b>Location:</b> Soviet Union (northern Ukraine)
		<p><b>Date:</b> April 26th, 1986
		<p><b>Description:</b> Near 1:00 in the morning at the Chernobyl Power Plant in Pripyat, USSR, the plant exploded. In short, it was caused due to human error. Due to Soviet incompetence and cost-cutting, the plant was basically put into overdrive, ignoring safety measures and any and all barriers in the way. The plant was an RBMK reactor, a type of reactor made by the USSR that uses enriched uranium. Chernobyl did not have a structure to contain its explosion in the event of a meltdown, so you can probably see where this is going. The reactor, already with a screwy construction, had a "power surge" when lead scientists attempted to shut it down. Consequently, the whole thing went into meltdown, and Chernobyl Reactor 4 exploded. The rest is history. 56 died directly from its effects, mostly from horrible burns and cancer, specifically thyroid. An unknown number died later over the years, mostly from cancers as their chromosomes and epidemis got pan-seared like a steak.

		<p><b>Location:</b> Japan
		<p><b>Date:</b> March 11th, 2011
		<p><b>Description:</b> In early March 2011, a large tsunami from the Pacific struck Japan (as they tend to do). While it caused tremendous damage, this would not be the last of Japan's concerns. As a result of the tsunami and its damage, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant was heavily damaged. Its power supply was directly affected, as was its cooling systems. It had three cores, all of which melted quickly. Soon after (within the first few days, in fact), intensive releases of radiation flew into the air around the plant in the local regions. After two weeks, the plants were relatively contained within safe levels, but some water would remain contaminated. None died, but the region is abandoned and not suitable for habitation. A massive effort has now been underway this whole time in the area affected to remove the entire layer of topsoil, which is the part of the dirt exposed to the air and, hence, fallout. Interestingly, this event caused so much fear that Japan soon after shut down all of the nuclear power in their country. Why would they do that if it was so safe?

		<p><b>Location:</b> Soviet Union (southern Russia)
		<p><b>Date:</b> September 29th, 1957
		<p><b>Description:</b> In late September of 1957 in Chelyabinsk, south-central Russia (USSR), a "Level 6" disaster occurred. The Mayak plant, a nuclear reactor in the closed city of Ozyorsk, at the time contained a serious amount of plutonium, which was used in making the Soviet Union's first atomic bomb. Regardless, on September 29, 1957, the cooling system had an accent and would not engage. An explosion welled up from within the plant, powerfully blowing off the lid of the container that held the fuel, now exposing all that material to the open air. Quickly, it released a toxic amount of radiation into the air. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/lethal-dose-ld.html">states</a> that 4-5 sieverts of radiation is lethal within 30 days. Needless to say, this dose was met in spades. 200 people died from sickness. Soon after, the radiation escaped and spread out over an area of 500 miles. The Soviet government kept this whole ordeal under wraps for a long time, meaning millions of people were completely unaware they had a looming cloud of cancer above their heads. The waste products and radioactive remnants were buried in Lake Karachay nearby; to this day, Lake Karachay remains one of the most polluted spots on the planet and is certainly enough to kill you if you are near it for too long.

		<p><b>Location:</b> United Kingdom (northwest England)
		<p><b>Date:</b> October 8th, 1957
		<p><b>Description:</b> On the 8th of October, 1957 (again?), in Cumbria, England, the most serious nuclear disaster in the history of the UK happened. Essentially, the Windscale Nuclear Power Plant had two nuclear reactors, both of which were cooled by gas and used graphite. The first reactor had an accident which oxidized its uranium, spewing radiation and creating a hellish, toxic fire that burned for about 16 hours. It left behind 10 tens of melted fuel. Another scary part is that in a 200-mile radius around the plant (Britain is a relatively small island, so 200 miles makes quite the circle), the British government banned any and all sale of milk because it could be contaminated by the cows being exposed to radiation sickness. They minimized the seriousness of the event to avoid public panic. The reactor was simply sealed up until the 1980s and minor cleanup and checkups still go on today.
