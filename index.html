			<h2>What even <i>is</i> nuclear energy?</h2>
			<div id="fuelcycle"><img src="images/Nuclear_Fuel_Cycle.png" alt="Fuel Cycle" class="desktop"></div>
			<p>Google defines <b>nuclear energy</b> as "the energy released during nuclear fission or fusion, especially when used to generate electricity." While this is a good definition, I personally feel it gives people a false sense of security; that nuclear energy is "just like all the others". This definition, while scientific and accurate, makes it easy for curious readers to believe it is approachable and understood, rather than a colossal burden to scientists, urban planners, safety experts, architects, and many more.<br>
			<p>Currently, according to the World Nuclear Association, over 50 countries have nuclear power on 5 continents (the two that don't are Oceania and Antarctica, if you're wondering). 9 countries have nuclear weapons, meaning that out of almost 200 nations, only 9 control the fate of mankindâ€”some of whom are simply regional powers. The diagram you see to your left is a simplified process of how nuclear energy works (public domain; credit goes to Tungsten on Wikipedia).<br><hr>
			<div id="info1"><p>Nuclear energy, in basic terms, works in two different ways: fission and fusion. Fission involves radioactive atoms, such as uranium-235 and plutonium, splitting their nucleus apart. The particles, usually neutrons, coming off creates a huge amount of energy. Then, the material is placed into fuel rods. These rods get incredibly hot. Some are almost half the temperature of the Sun. <i>(Remember, these are paid for by your tax dollars and put within view of your backyard.)</i> The rods are put into water to cool them down, causing a large amount of steam which is then turned en masse and creates clean energy.<br><p>Fusion is far more uncommon; two nuclei in two atoms are "fused" together to form a bigger nucleus. The energy that is released from this fusion is then turned into heat and energy which is harvested and used in the reaction. Nuclear fusion is far harder to achieve and far more expensive; however, it releases more energy on average than fission.<br><p><i>**This is a sidenote, but another reason to not support nuclear energy is because many of its most adamant supporters have a proclivity to resort to insults and ad hominems, such as referring to their interlocutors as being anti-science, luddites, anti-human, fearmongerers, and more. If any other belief's supporters resorted to that, one would ought be inclined to avoid any dialogue on it, yet most positions are noticeably not as serious as the fate of the world's energy production.
			<br><p>The cult following nuclear energy has is parallel to the following a cult leader has on their subjects: there is basically zero information online which goes against this dominant narrative. The scarce info pieces on YouTube describing the cons of nuclear are buried under an hour of fluff, flooded with hate comments instead of open-minded people looking to explore actual alternatives in a civil dialogue.</i></div>

			<h2>Why be against nuclear energy?</h2>
			<div id="francegraph"><img src="images/Electricity_in_France.svg.png"></div>
			<p>There are many reasons to be against the use of nuclear energy, as further discussed on additional pages. This being a hot-button topic, there are indeed a number of bizarre and over-used talking points to refute. Here are just a few reasons why you should take a stand against nuclear.

			<ul>
				<li>1.&emsp;Reactors have a tendency to poison people. Everyone wants the clean, sleek, modern, power-generating nuclear plant in their town. However, when they suddenly go within line of sight in <i>your</i> backyard, all of a sudden, the reactor magically becomes less-wanted.
				<li>2.&emsp;It is the trendy new thing. Anyone who does not choose this is looked down upon and often seen as "not educated on the subject", a view that ignores the many, many, many, many complex factors that go into this subject. Frankly, anything with this amount of followers and ardent defenders would seem like a cult to anyone else.
				<li>3.&emsp;Many nuclear plants in the US are leaking at abnormal or unsafe levels &mdash; but don't take my word for it, <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/tritium-radiation-fs.html">take the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission's</a> word for it. The USNRC talks about how there are unsafe and "abnormal" leaks of tritium in the groundwater in many nuclear plants. The common reply is that these levels are at safe, near-untraceable levels. Here's a reverse question: even at tiny levels, do you want tritium &mdash; a radioactive isotope &mdash; in your water at all?
				<li>Below is a video from Greenpeace, an environmental organization founded in 1971. (I would like to note that I do not support everything they do and oppose many of their stunts and views; however, they are against nuclear energy, which I fully agree with.) There are so few videos online which go against the common nuclear narrative that the following video is in French, but is a good source nonetheless. Please, I encourage you to watch it and consider the evidence! Your paycheck, environment, and community are on the line.
